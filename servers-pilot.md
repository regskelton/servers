# **Pilot Episode --- "The First Boot"**

**Starring Richter Dixon**

## **COLD OPEN**

**INT. TECHOPS WAR ROOM -- NIGHT**

Rows of monitors glow. Alarms flash. Engineers scramble.

**LEAD ENGINEER**\
Production's collapsing! The customer queue is doubling every thirty
seconds!

The door SLAMS open.

Enter **RICHTER DIXON (40s)**---hoodie, wild hair, eyes sharp, fingers
twitching like they're already typing.

**RICHTER**\
Alright---who broke what, why, when, and at what velocity? And if you
say "we don't know," congratulations on achieving enlightenment.\
Move.

He drops into the main chair. His typing is a blur.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **ACT I**

**INT. IT WAR ROOM -- SAME NIGHT**

**RICHTER**\
We're losing servers like socks in a public laundromat. Symptoms---go.

**ENGINEER #1**\
Random hangs. CPU spikes. Maybe a deadlock?

**RICHTER**\
"Maybe" is for dating apps. Next.

**ENGINEER #2**\
Network partition?

**RICHTER**\
If only it were that sexy.

He scrolls through logs at superhuman speed.

**ENGINEER #3**\
Memory leak?

**RICHTER**\
You don't believe that. I don't believe that. The servers don't believe
that. Let's all agree to stop lying.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **ACT II**

**INT. SERVER AISLE -- LATER**

Richter moves between racks like a caffeinated ghost.

**RICHTER**\
You and me, servers---we communicate. You scream. I listen. It's
healthier than most relationships.

He yanks a panel off.

**ENGINEER #1**\
We shouldn't touch hardware until---

**RICHTER**\
---until it asks politely? Pass.

He attempts fix after fix. They fail. Pressure rises.

**CTO (VIA MONITOR)**\
Richter, the CEO wants an update.

**RICHTER**\
Tell them: "Not my fault yet." Add a slightly threatening emoji.

**CTO**\
...Which one?

**RICHTER**\
Dealer's choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **ACT III**

**INT. WAR ROOM -- LATER**

Richter draws diagrams at Mach 2.

**RICHTER**\
Not the DB. Not the network. Not the kernel. Not the drivers.\
So what's left?

The room holds its breath.

He steps to the master console.

Touches one key.

Powers the entire system **OFF**.

Gasps erupt.

Then he powers it **ON**.

Everything instantly stabilizes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **ACT IV -- EPILOGUE**

**INT. WAR ROOM -- CALM**

**ENGINEER #3**\
So what fixed it?

**RICHTER**\
I turned it off and on again.

They stare.

**RICHTER**\
Hey, simplicity is just complexity that's been bullied into submission.\
See you all tomorrow.

He walks out, typing invisibly in the air.

FADE OUT.
